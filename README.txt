This program finds the height of a ball after being dropped at a specified time.
The ball is dropped from a height(meters), the height of a ledge, over time (seconds).
This program ignores air resistance. User enters height and time.

Over time I plan to expand this program to identify when the ball hit the ground, as
well as display a graphical representation.

To run the program, run the corresponding "python ball.py" command in your terminal 
(may require version name like "python3.10 ball.py" if not working properly) or open 
the file in your Python IDE of choice and click run.
